# Business Insights: Customer Churn

**Top Drivers (global importance):**
- Contract (Month-to-month vs. annual)
- Tenure
- MonthlyCharges
- InternetService & add-on bundles

**Actions:**
1. Offer contract upgrade incentives to high‑risk month‑to‑month users.
2. Launch onboarding nudges for new/high‑bill customers (bill‑shock prevention).
3. Bundle security/backup to increase stickiness.
4. Prioritize proactive outreach lists from `output/predictions.csv` where `y_prob>=0.6`.
